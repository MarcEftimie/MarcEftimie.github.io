## Pipelined RISC-V CPU (WIP)

I designed a pipelined RISC-V CPU in System Verilog for my computer architecture class final project. This processor supports almost all I, S, R, B, and J instructions for the RV32I instruction set. Down below, you can explore the repository that includes all of the code for this project!
